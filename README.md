Firstly We can get information by running the following code

python crackerBF.py -h

later

python crackerBF.py -hf targethash.txt -w passwordlist.txt

Hashfile and wordlist files are given as examples. You can run the code by giving the wordlist you want to try and the hash value you have captured.

Exam:

python crackerBF.py -hf <> -w <>

python sha256hashGene.py
